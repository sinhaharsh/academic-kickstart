abstract: "Deep learning based methods have achieved remarkable success in image restoration and enhancement, but most such methods rely on RGB input images. These methods fail to take into account the rich spectral distribution of natural images. We propose a deep architecture, SpecNet, which computes spectral profile to estimate pixel-wise dynamic range adjustment of a given image. First, we employ an unpaired cycle-consistent framework to generate hyperspectral images (HSI) from low-light input images. HSI is further used to generate a normal light image of the same scene. We incorporate a self-supervision and a spectral profile regularization network to infer a plausible HSI from an RGB image. We evaluate the benefits of optimizing the spectral profile for real and fake images in low-light conditions on the LOL Dataset."
